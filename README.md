# Mall-Customer-Segmentation

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately.
In this Project I have performed  an Exploratory Data Analysis on the Mall Customer Data . Furthermore I have  used K - Means Clustering Algorithm to create Customer Segmentation (Clusters of different type of Customers).
